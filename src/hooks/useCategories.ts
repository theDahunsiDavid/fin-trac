/**
 * Custom hook for managing category state in the FinTrac app.
 *
 * This hook provides a foundation for category management, allowing future expansion of categorization features. Currently a placeholder, it's designed to support dynamic category creation and selection, enhancing transaction organization.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - Categories will be stored and managed similarly to transactions.
 * - State management follows the same pattern as useTransactions.
 *
 * Edge cases:
 * - Initially returns an empty array, allowing the app to function without predefined categories.
 * - Placeholder implementation doesn't fetch or persist data yet.
 *
 * Connections:
 * - Intended for use in TransactionForm for dynamic category selection.
 * - Will integrate with CategoryRepository once implemented.
 * - Supports the app's goal of flexible transaction categorization.
